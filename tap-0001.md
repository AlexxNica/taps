What is a TAP?
==============

TAP stands for TUF Augmentation Proposal.  A TAP is a design document providing information to the TUF community, or describing a new feature for TUF or its processes or environment.  The TAP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

We intend TAPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into TUF.  The TAP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the TAPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

TAP Types
=========

There are three kinds of TAP:

1. A *Standards Track* TAP describes a new feature or implementation for TUF.

2. An *Informational* TAP describes a TUF design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the TUF community, but does not propose a new feature.  Informational TAPs do not necessarily represent a TUF community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational TAPs or follow their advice.

3. A *Process* TAP describes a process surrounding TUF, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process TAPs are like Standards Track TAPs but apply to areas other than TUF itself.  They may propose an implementation, but not to TUF's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational TAPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in TUF development. Any meta-TAP is also considered a Process TAP.

TAP Workflow
============

TUF's BDFL
----------

There are several reference in this TAP to the "BDFL". This acronym stands for "Benevolent Dictator for Life" and refers to Justin Cappos, the original creator of, and the final design authority for, the TUF software update framework.

TAP Editors
-----------

The TAP editors are individuals responsible for managing the administrative and editorial aspects of the TAP workflow (e.g. assigning TAP numbers and changing their status).  See "TAP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow" for details. The current editors are:

* Vladimir Diaz
* Sebastien Awwad
* Trishank Karthik Kuppusamy
* Lois Anne DeLong

TAP editorship is by invitation of the current editors. The address <theupdateframework@googlegroups.com> is a mailing list for contacting the TAP editors. All email related to TAP administration (such as requesting a TAP number or providing an updated version of a TAP for posting) should be sent to this address.

Submitting a TAP
----------------

The TAP process begins with a new idea for TUF.  It is highly recommended that each TAP contain a single key proposal or new idea. Small enhancements or patches often don't need a TAP and can be injected into the TUF development workflow with a patch submission to the TUF [issue tracker](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/issues).

The more focused the TAP, the more successful it tends to be.  The TAP editors reserve the right to reject TAP proposals if they appear too unfocused or too broad.  If in doubt, split your TAP into several well-focused ones.

Each TAP must have a champion -- someone who writes the TAP using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea.  The TAP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is TAP-able. Posting to the TUF mailing list is the best way to go about this.

Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a TAP is meant to save the potential author time. Many ideas have been brought forward for changing TUF that have been rejected for various reasons. Asking the TUF community first if an idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching the internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most people in most areas where TUF is used.

Once the champion has asked the TUF community whether an idea has any chance of acceptance, a draft TAP should be presented to the TUF mailing list.  This gives the author a chance to flesh out the draft TAP to ensure it is properly formatted, of high quality, and to address initial concerns about the proposal.

Following a discussion on the TUF mailing list, the proposal should be sent as a draft TAP to the TAP editors <theupdateframework@googlegroups.com>.  The draft must be written in TAP style as described below, else it will be sent back without further regard until proper formatting rules are followed (although minor errors will be corrected by the editors).

If the TAP editors approve, they will assign the TAP a number, label it as Standards Track, Informational, or Process, give it status "Draft", and create and check-in the initial draft of the TAP.  The TAP editors will not unreasonably deny a TAP.  Reasons for denying TAP status include duplication of effort, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or not in keeping with the TUF philosophy.  The BDFL can be consulted during the approval phase, and is the final arbiter of the draft's TAP-ability.

Developers with git push privileges for the [TAP repository](https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps) may claim TAP numbers directly by creating and committing a new TAP. When doing so, the developer must handle the tasks that would normally be taken care of by the TAP editors (see "TAP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow"). This includes ensuring the initial version meets the expected standards for submitting a TAP. Alternately, even developers may choose to submit TAPs through the TAP editors. When doing so, let the TAP editors know you have git push privileges and they can guide you through the process of updating the TAP repository directly.

As updates are necessary, the TAP author can check in new versions if they (or a collaborating developer) have git push privileges, or else they can email new TAP versions to the TAP editors for publication.

After a TAP number has been assigned, a draft TAP may be discussed further on the TUF mailing list (getting a TAP number assigned early can be useful for ease of reference, especially when multiple draft TAPs are being considered at the same time). Eventually, all Standards Track TAPs must  be sent to the TUF mailing list for review as described in the next section.

Standards Track TAPs consist of two parts, a design document and an augmented reference implementation. It is generally recommended that at least a prototype implementation be co-developed with the TAP, as ideas that sound good in principle sometimes turn out to be impractical when subjected to the test of implementation.

TAP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on a TAP before submitting it for review. All comments should be gathered on a GitHub issue specific to the TAP.

TAP Review & Resolution
-----------------------

Once the authors have completed a TAP, they may request a review for style and consistency from the TAP editors.  However, the content and final acceptance of the TAP must be requested of the BDFL, usually via an email to the TUF mailing list.  TAPs are reviewed by the BDFL and his chosen consultants, who may accept or reject a TAP or send it back to the author(s) for revision. For a TAP that is predetermined to be acceptable (e.g., it is an obvious win as-is and/or its implementation has already been checked in) the BDFL may also initiate a TAP review, first notifying the TAP author(s) and giving them a chance to make revisions.

For a TAP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement.  The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate the framework unduly.  Finally, a proposed enhancement must be "practical" in order to be accepted by the BDFL. (However, "practical" is an imprecise term; it may be defined as whatever is acceptable to the BDFL.  This logic is intentionally circular.)

Once a TAP has been accepted, the augmented reference implementation must be completed.  When the augmented reference implementation is complete and incorporated into the main source code repository, the status will be changed to "Final."

A TAP can also be assigned status "Deferred". The TAP author or an editor can assign the TAP this status when no progress is being made on the TAP. Once a TAP is deferred, a TAP editor can re-assign it to draft status. A TAP may be "Deferred" for a period of at most a year.

A TAP can also be "Rejected".  Perhaps after all is said and done it was not a good idea.  It is still important to have a record of this fact. The "Withdrawn" status is similar - it means that the TAP author themselves has decided that the TAP is actually a bad idea, or has accepted that a competing proposal is a better alternative.

When a TAP is Accepted, Rejected or Withdrawn, the TAP should be updated accordingly. In addition to updating the status field, at the very least the Resolution header should be added with a link to the relevant post in the TUF mailing list archives.

TAPs can also be superseded by a different TAP, rendering the original obsolete. This is intended for Informational TAPs, where version 2 of an API can replace version 1.

The possible paths of the status of TAPs are as follows:

Some Informational and Process TAPs may also have a status of "Active" if they are never meant to be completed.  E.g. TAP 1 (this TAP).

TAP Maintenance
---------------

In general, Standards track TAPs are no longer modified after they have reached the Final state. Once a TAP has been completed, the Reference Implementation become the formal documentation of the expected behavior.

Informational and Process TAPs may be updated over time to reflect changes to development practices and other details. The precise process followed in these cases will depend on the nature and purpose of the TAP being updated.

What belongs in a successful TAP?
=================================

Each TAP should have the following parts:

1. Preamble -- [RFC 822](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822) style headers containing meta-data about the TAP, including the TAP number, a short descriptive title (limited to a maximum of 44 characters), the names, and optionally the contact info for each author, etc.

2. Abstract -- a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.
Copyright/public domain -- Each TAP must either be explicitly labeled as placed in the public domain (see this TAP as an example) or licensed under the [Open Publication License](https://opencontent.org/openpub/).

3. Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.  The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for at least the current major TUF platforms (TUF, Notary, go-tuf).

4. Motivation -- The motivation is critical for TAPs that want to change TUF. It should clearly explain why the existing framework specification is inadequate to address the problem that the TAP solves.  TAP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

5. Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other frameworks. The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

6. Security Analysis -- The TAP should show, in as simple as possible a manner, why the proposal would not detract from existing security guarantees. (In other words, the proposal should either maintain or add to existing security.) This need not entail a mathematical proof. For example, it may suffice to provide a case-by-case analysis of key compromise over all foreseeable roles. To take another example, if a change is made to delegation, it must preserve existing delegation semantics (unless the TAP makes a good argument for breaking the semantics).

7. Backwards Compatibility -- All TAPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity.  The TAP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. TAP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

8. Augmented Reference Implementation -- The augmented reference implementation must be completed before any TAP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the TAP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details. The final implementation must include test code and documentation appropriate for the TUF reference.

TAP Formats and Templates
=========================

TAPs are UTF-8 encoded text files using the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format. Markdown allows for rich markup that is still quite easy to read, but also results in good-looking and functional HTML. [TAP 2](https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps/blob/master/tap-0002.md) contains instructions and a template for MarkDown TAPs.
